/* INFORMATION ON PRISM HEADERS
 *
 * Its a bit hard to get reliable information on Prism headers
 * The following information has been "gleamed" from examining
 * other drivers
 *
 * Endianness:  Prism headers are in "host" order
 *
 * did:     values are #defined below
 *
 * status:   0 indicates that the parameter is supplied by the driver
 *     1 indicates that the driver doesn't supply the parameter.
 *     if not supplied it should be ignored
 *
 * len:     1-4  This is the number of bytes in the data field
 *            In all the drivers I have looked at, this value has always been 4
 *
 * data:      The actual value - if all bits are not used they should be zeroed
 *
 *
 * The Broadcom driver PRISM header supplies:
 *
 * hosttime:  In jiffies - for our system this is in 10ms units
 *
 * mactime: In micro-seconds - not much use to us, we want it in milliseconds
 *     a 32 bit usec timer will will role over in just over an hour.
 *     Drivers appear to use a 64bit counter to hold mactime internal
 *     the then fill the prism header with the lower 32 bits
 *
 * channel: Not Supplied
 *
 * rssi:     Appears to be a signed dbm value
 *
 * sq:     Signal quality - I think that this is something to do with the number
 *            of errors received
 *
 * signal:     Should be the signal strength in dbm - but doesn't appear to be.
 *     I have seen some drivers use a value of 100-(signal in dbm) to
 *     provide a positive integer.  We are getting a value of "2"
 *
 * noise:     Not Supplied - Should be signed dbm value
 *
 * rate:     Appears to be in units/multiples of 500Khz
 *
 * istx:     Not Supplied  - 0 = rx packet, 1 = tx packet
 *
 * frmlen:     Length of the following frame in bytes
 *
 *
