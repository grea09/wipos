\section{List of application features}

The lab work took place on seven 3-hours sessions.

This part describes what features we have implemented and how much time does it
took.

\subsection{Positioning server}

\subsection{Android application}

The android application interface took about 6 our to be implemented and tested.

\subsection{Wi-Fi air point}

During the first lab session, we set our workspace the virtual machine, 
the router, etc. (About 2-3 hours).

The Wi-Fi air point (AP) program implements a doubly linked list of the devices
detected and the RSSI received. It took about 6-7 hours.

It also implements a socket communication with the server. About 1 hours to
program it.
