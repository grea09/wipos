\section{Conclusion}

This project was very interesting because it gave us the opportunity to work on
several parts of the indoor positioning mechanism.

We increased our programing skills in Java, JavaEE, SQL and C. Also, we could create an
Android application and a server, introducing ourselves to servlet development
and tomcat server.
