\subsection{Running the air point program}

You have to compile the router program : in the router directory run \verb+make+
and then send the generated binary called \verb+router+ to the router via scp.

Log as root on the rooter and run the command 

\verb+# iwc monitor 1+

to enable the \verb+prism0+ interface.

Then, run our program using the following command :

\verb+# ./router+

This way, the air point listen to the RSSI messages and can reply to the server
requests.
