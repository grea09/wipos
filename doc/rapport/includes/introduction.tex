\section*{Introduction}

During our studies at the UTBM, we attend the LO53 course, concerning
concerning the techniques and applications of the positioning systems. 

During the lab work, we had to build a full Wi-Fi based positioning system, 
based on 3 parts :

\begin{itemize}
    \item Wi-Fi access points
    \item Android terminals
    \item Positioning server
\end{itemize}

This paper describes our work on this subject. For each of the three parts we
will explain how we manage to achieve the objectives, and where we had some
difficulties.
